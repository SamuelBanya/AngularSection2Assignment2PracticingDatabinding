* Assignment Goal
1. Add an input field which updates a property ("username") via Two-Way-Binding
2. Output the username property via String Interpolation (in a paragraph below the input)
3. Add a button which may only be clicked if the username is NOT an empty String
4. Upon clicking the button, the username should be reset to an empty string 

* Biggest Takeways
Do NOT put import 'FormControls' within the module section --> This ended up causing me some very weird errors
